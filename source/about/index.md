# ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE

***

### *Real-time Ship Tracking With Fusion of Kalman Filter and CenterNet, Unmanned System Institute of SYSU, Guangzhou——Apr 2019-Dec 2019*

*  Proposed an approach which is customized for the ship tracking task. In this approach, a deep learning-based update method has been specially designed to be integrated with the Kalman filter for correcting possible predictable errors.
*  Compared with SOTA trackers in different challenging scenarios, our approach demonstrated higher accuracy and greater robustness, achieving 89.9\% F1-measure and 108 fps. 
*  Achieved the largest Chinese public data set currently used in ship detecting missions through ship-based and shore-based cameras which are capable of capturing multiple targets in various scenarios.

### *Lightweight Super-resolution Generative Adversarial Network, Intelliengence Science & System Lab of SYSU—— Jun 2019-Present*

- Proposed a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) with a lightweight network. Replaced the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block with mobile inverted bottleneck MBConv to reduce the floating point operations(FLOPs) and parameters of the model.
- Combined the Wasserstein General Adversarial Networks (WGAN) with SRGAN, using Wasserstein distance, the distribution difference between the data sets and the Wasserstein loss were measured.

### *Music Generation Based on Action Analysis——Nov 2019-Jan 2020*

-  Proposed a Style Music Generation Based on Action Analysis consisting pose estimation key points, music GAN and music style translation.
- Adopted 3D CNN(C3D) and bi-directional Long Short Term Memory(bi-LSTM) for action analysis. Used Multi-Track Sequential Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) for original melody generation and Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks(Cycle-GAN) combined with Wavenet for specific music style translation based on various classes of actions.

## HORORS AND AWARDS

### *China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling，Recond Price——Sep 2018*

- Top 3 teams of 700+ participating teams in SYSU. 
-  Adopted a heat conduction model based on recessive finite difference method and genetic algorithm for to evaluate the thermal insulation performance of special high-temperature cloth.

### *Scholarship of Sun Yat-Sen University，Recond Price——2019*
