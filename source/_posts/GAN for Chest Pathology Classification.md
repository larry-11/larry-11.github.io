# Motivation

1. **limited**: preservation of patient privacy is paramount, and hence access to data is often intrinsically limited to research groups 
2. **imbalance**: over-representation of common medical problems and a paucity of data from rare conditions

# Contribution

1. implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create artificial images based upon a modest sized labeled dataset
2. augmenting the original imbalanced dataset with GAN generated images improves performance of chest pathology classification using the proposed DCNN in comparison to the same DCNN trained with the original dataset alone.
